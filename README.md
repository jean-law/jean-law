# 👋 Hi there, I’m Jean Law

- 👀 I’m interested in using machine learning tools to manage the rampant mis-/disinformation on social media.
- 🌱 I’m currently in my third year of studies in the ingénieur polytechnicien program at Ecole Polytechnique, developing my knowledge on data science and graph algorithms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on analyzing the network structure of social media data. 
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn],(https://www.linkedin.com/in/jean-law/) <a href="mailto:lawjean1999@gmail.com">E-mail</a>

## Summary of my past projects:
- inf554-assessment: Implemented in Python dimensioniality-reduction algorithms such as PCA and MDS to denoise images and give a low-rank approximation of the image. 
- sonar-shape-classifier: A CNN that permits the use of a HC-SR04 Arduino SONAR, despite its low lateral precision, to collect data on an object and determine whether it has a cylindrical or a flat contour. Developed in Python (Tensorflow).

## Active projects:
- imdb-database: The final aim of this project is to set up a web application that enables users to exploit a movie database.
- multi-query-optimization: I am devising an efficient algorithm to compute efficiently a set of Entity-to-Entity paths present in a ConnectionLens graph, which is a data journalist knowledge graph that integrates heterogenous data structures.
