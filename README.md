# 👋 Hi there, I’m Jean Law

- 👀 I’m interested in using machine learning tools to manage the rampant mis-/disinformation on social media.
- 🌱 I’m currently in my third year of studies in the ingénieur polytechnicien program at Ecole Polytechnique, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I am particiularly interested in developing my knowledge on data science and graph algorithms.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on projects that involve analyzing the network structure of social media data.

## Summary of my past projects:
- inf554-assessment: Implemented in Python dimensioniality-reduction algorithms such as PCA and MDS to denoise images and give a low-rank approximation of the image. 
- sonar-shape-classifier: A CNN, developed in Python (Tensorflow), that permits the use of a HC-SR04 Arduino SONAR, despite its low lateral precision, to collect data on an object and determine whether it has a cylindrical or a flat contour. 

## Active projects:
- multi-query-optimization: I am devising an efficient algorithm to compute efficiently a set of Entity-to-Entity paths present in a ConnectionLens graph, which is a data journalist knowledge graph that integrates heterogenous data structures. I have done the state of the art on this subject, and am currently implementing the algorithms that I have devised in Java.
- imdb-database: The final aim of this project is to set up a web application that enables users to exploit a movie database. At present, I have set up the database as well as optimized the queries to improve their execution time.
